 A Plugin should have an ID.
 The official plugin list is available here: https://www.letscontrolit.com/wiki/index.php/Official_plugin_list
 The plugin playground is available here: https://github.com/letscontrolit/ESPEasyPluginPlayground

 Use the next available ID. The maximum number of Plugins is defined in ESPEasy-Globals.h (PLUGIN_MAX)

 The Plugin filename should be of the form "_Pxxx_name.ino", where:
    xxx is the ID
    <name> is a short name of the Plugin
 As an example: "_P001_Switch.ino"

Hints for plugin development:
 - plugins should ideally be added without changes in the framework
 - avoid including libraries. Include the necessary code in the plugin
 - when verifying the plugin check the following:
     - memory used (try different scenarios: plugin enabled, plugin in use, commands executed, plugin disabled, device added/removed)
     - other tests??
 - the development life-cycle is:
     - implement plugin and perform testing
     - set plugin status to DEVELOPMENT and distribute to other users for testing
     - after sufficient usage and possible code correction, set plugin status to TESTING and perform testing with more users
     - finally, plugin will be accepted in project
 - along with the plugin source code, prepare a wiki page containing:
     - instructions on how to make the necessary configuration
     - instructions on commands (if any)
     - examples: plugin usage, command usage,...
 - when a plugin is removed (deleted), make sure you free any memory it uses. Use PLUGIN_EXIT for that
 - if your plugin creates log entries, prefix your entries with your plugin id: "[Pxxx] my plugin did this"
 - if your plugin takes input from user and/or accepts/sends http commands, make sure you properly handle non-alphanumeric characters correctly
 - After ESP boots, all devices can send data instantly. If your plugin is for a sensor which sends data, ensure it doesn't need a delay before receiving data
 - ensure the plugin does not create sideffects (eg. crashes) if there's no actual device connected
- check the device's return values. Ensure that if the device returns an invalid value, to use a value like 0 or null to avoid side-effects

//#include section
//include libraries here. For example:
//#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>

//uncomment one of the following as needed
//#ifdef PLUGIN_BUILD_DEVELOPMENT
//#ifdef PLUGIN_BUILD_TESTING

//#define PLUGIN_xxx
//#define PLUGIN_ID_xxx     xxx               //plugin id
//#define PLUGIN_NAME_xxx   "Plugin Name"     //"Plugin Name" is what will be dislpayed in the selection list

//#define PLUGIN_VALUENAME2_xxx "output2"     //multiple outputs are supported

PIN/port configuration is stored in the following:
CONFIG_PIN1 - The first GPIO pin selected within the task
CONFIG_PIN2 - The second GPIO pin selected within the task
CONFIG_PIN3 - The third GPIO pin selected within the task
CONFIG_PORT - The port in case the device has multiple in/out pins

Custom configuration is stored in the following:
PCONFIG(x)
x can be between 1 - 8 and can store values between -32767 - 32768 (16 bit)

N.B. these are aliases for a longer less readable amount of code. See _Plugin_Helper.h
